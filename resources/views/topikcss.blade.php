    <p class="id1">Selama sekitar lima tahun di Jepang,
        saya bekerja tanpa lelah siang dan malam di
        sebuah perusahaan IT sebagai pekerja kantor biasa,
        terlibat dalam produksi web dan pemasaran internet.

        saya menyadari pada usia 28 tahun, menjelang usia 30, bahwa saya tidak bisa
        membiarkan hidup saya berakhir seperti ini.
